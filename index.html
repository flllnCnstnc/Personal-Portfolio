            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <p> Nice to meet you! I am Constance, a college student who is pursuing a degree in computer
                    science with a focus on web development. I have always been passionate about technology
                    and have spent much of my free time learning programming languages likeHTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript.I have already built several applications.
                </p>
                <p>As a new web developer in college, I am eager to learn as much as I can and put my skills
                    to use. I am constantly exploring new technologies and experimenting with different
                    approaches to web development. While I know I still have much to learn, I am excited about
                    the potential of web development and the impact I can have on the world.
